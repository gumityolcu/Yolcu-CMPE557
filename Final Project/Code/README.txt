Different main() functions are written to generate different results.

These functions are commented out in the main function and comments are given at the beginning of each one that explain the purpose of that main function.


The code uses the linear algebra library Eigen. The library files are included and a makefile is given. Execute 'make' to compile then './LanguageDynamics' to run.

Code compiles and runs without problems on Ubuntu 16 with gcc 7.4.0
